Previously, only programmers could code. Everyone else had to use predefined software or ask a friend for help.

Everything changed with code agents. It sounds like it's for programmers, but it's actually for everyone.

Rebyte was born to bridge the gap. We run state-of-the-art code agents on the cloud for everyone.

From repetitive tasks like data cleaning, spreadsheets, and building websites.

To complex coding projects—importing GitHub repos, fixing bugs, deploying to production.

Each task runs in an isolated cloud environment. And we equip every agent with human-level skills—specialized knowledge for your specific workflows.

See what's possible. Real results from real users.

Rebyte. Vibe working with skilled code agents.
